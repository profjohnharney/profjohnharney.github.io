I like to take photographs of human-made things intervening in the world, or being dwarfed or swallowed up by the world around them. But in general I am happy to take photographs that work with the light - the whole point, really! - and see where ideas take me. I live in a small town in central Kentucky, and there are plenty of ideas around. As Matt Hall [very correctly points out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sctfoIZtkY) if you live in a smaller place or less obviously photogenic place, just "look harder." So. I'm trying. :)

You can check out prints of some of my work at my [Etsy store](https://harneyphotography.etsy.com). 

I use a Canon EOS 100D (known as a Rebel SL1 in the US), usually with a [24mm f2.8](https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/ef-s-24mm-f-2-8-stm?color=Black&type=New) lens, and a Panasonic G1, often with adapted Konica AR lenses such as the [40mm f1.8](https://lenslegend.com/konica-hexanon-ar-40mm-f1-8/).
